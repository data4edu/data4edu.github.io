# How can I evaluate the quality of teacher training programmes?

To evaluate the quality of teacher training programmes, three aspects and related data can be looked into. These are: 

1. How well is the training developed?
    1. Some states assess the training needs of the participants. Analyse this data against the training given. 
    2. Check the number of training imparted from UDISE data. Then analyse the NAS/SLAS data against training given to get an insight into the training required against what was imparted. 
2. How well is the training implemented? 
    1. Check the training components i.e., curriculum design, training methods and monitoring mechanisms to see if the training is planned phase-wise, is targeted to improve certain outcomes, employs an ongoing process monitoring mechanism that can inform the training being conducted. 
    2. Check if the training implements a clear and practical model of mentoring teachers, providing supportive supervision and peer learning networks. 
    3. Check if the training indicates performance standards for each level (teacher educators-supervisors-teachers) with scope for each to assess themselves and assist their growth. 
3. How effective is the training in making a difference to actual classroom teaching? 
    1. Check the pre-test and post-test questions designed to assess teacher competency. 
    2. Check if the training has a mechanism of recording near real-time data on teacher performance to modify the training plan.
