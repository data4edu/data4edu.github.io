# How can I use PAB data to show that my state should be provided more funds?

Please note that the points offered below are just suggestions. The final decision for approval rests entirely on the Project Approval Board.

Using PAB (Project Approval Board) data to make a case for more funds for your state under Samagra Shiksha requires a systematic and data-driven approach. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Review the** [**Financial Management and Procurement Manual**](https://dsel.education.gov.in/sites/default/files/update/fmp.pdf): Begin by thoroughly reviewing the norms and guidelines laid down in the Financial Management and Procurement Manual. This will provide you with a clear understanding of the existing rules and procedures for fund allocation. So the first step should be to read through the norms to find out whether there is some existing scope for seeking additional funds for your state.
2. **Analyse Historical PAB Data:**
    1. **Component-wise Analysis:** Examine the historical PAB approvals for each component under Samagra Shiksha, such as Access & Retention, Vocational Education, Quality Education, etc. Calculate the percentage of the proposed amount that was approved for each component in previous years.
    2. **Identify Disparities:** Look for patterns and disparities in the approval percentages. If you find that some components consistently receive lower approvals compared to others, this could be a basis for seeking more funds for those specific components.
3. **Benchmarking against Similar States:** Create a list of states that are similar in terms of the number of schools and enrolment. Compare your state's PAB approvals with those of similar states. Additionally, calculate your state's rank on key performance metrics such as the Performance Grading Index (PGI) and National Achievement Survey (NAS). If your state has performed well on these metrics but still receives lower PAB approvals, it strengthens your case for increased funding.

It would be worth communicating with the Technical Support Group at the Ministry of Education and seek their guidance specific to your state.
