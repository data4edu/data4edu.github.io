# How to create a priority list of schools that need infrastructural support, using UDISE?

To create a priority list of schools that need infrastructural support, you can filter the list of schools based on indicators under the "physical facilities, equipment, computer and digital initiatives" category.

In this category, look for the following points to find out schools that need infrastructure support:
1. Type of school building â€“ *pucca*, partially *pucca*, *kuchha*, dilapidated building
2. Type of boundary wall
3. Type of classroom
4. Details on toilets
5. Availability of electricity
6. Ramp for disabled children
7. Kitchen shed availability
8. Availability of laboratories
9. Audio-visual aids
10. Computers
11. Availability of internet for pedagogical purpose
12. Assistive tech-based solution for CWSN students

Schools that are found lacking on most factors, should form your priority. 

To distinguish between schools with matching scores, you can use a scoring system for the indicators based on their importance. For example, a school without classroom should rank higher than one requiring computers etc.
