# What data do I see to know how many CWSN students in my school can avail of entitled government schemes?

The best place to start would be to see the list of entitlements available in your state.

At present, in some states, the CWSN children in class 1-12 are covered under the following 12 schemes â€“ medical cum functional assessment, prosthetic limbs and aids support, transport allowance, escort allowance, reader allowance, stipend for girls, construction for sports/environment, exposure visit, parent consultation programme, rehabilitation services, braille books, large print books, training to use laptop, smart phone and digi-player for the visually impaired (VI) students.

Check the number of students under each group i.e., VI, HI etc., to find out the number of students eligible under the scheme.
