# Is there any point in presenting the school data to the school management committee (SMC)? Will they be able to understand it? If I want them to, what should I do?

When presenting data to the SMC, it is important to provide relevant and meaningful information. Think of data that will be useful for the SMC based on what they should know, in order to make decisions. These are some types of school data that can be useful to show to the SMC:

1. Enrolment data – This data will help the SMC understand the student population and monitor enrolment trends.
2. Attendance data – This will give an idea of the attendance patterns to identify issues related to absenteeism or dropouts. This detail can be presented as the overall attendance percentage of the school, of specific stages (foundational, preparatory, middle or secondary) or specific classes.
3. Academic performance data – The exam results or assessment scores will give an idea of the overall academic progress of the students. This can be shown for each grade as overall average scores, subject-wise percentages or as comparison with previous years results.
4. Infrastructure and facilities data – This data will give an idea of the infrastructure available and that which is required. This can include details about classrooms, library, laboratories, sports facilities.
5. Financial data – Data on school’s budget, expenditure, and sources of funding can enable the SMC to make informed decisions about resource allocation and financial planning.
6. Teacher and staff data – Data related to number of teachers, their qualifications and experience level can be helpful to assess the staffing situation and identify gaps for improvement.
