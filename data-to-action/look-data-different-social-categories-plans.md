# Why should I look at data for different social categories when making plans?

Examining data for different social categories is essential when making educational plans because it allows for targeted and equitable decision-making.

Education systems are not one-size-fits-all, and disparities often exist among various social groups, such as economically disadvantaged students (EWS), children with disabilities (CWD), and gender-specific considerations, especially for girls. By delving into data that is disaggregated by these categories, you gain a comprehensive understanding of these disparities and can design strategies that address the unique needs and challenges faced by each group.

Moreover, analysing data for different social categories is a crucial step toward achieving social justice and inclusivity in education. It helps in identifying gaps in access, participation, and performance, which, if unaddressed, can perpetuate inequalities. For example, looking at attendance and dropout rates among EWS students may reveal barriers to their education, such as lack of resources or access to quality schools. Similarly, examining gender-specific data can highlight issues that hinder girls' education, like cultural biases or safety concerns. By recognizing these disparities, educational planners can develop policies and interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of each social category, ultimately working toward a more equitable and inclusive education system.
