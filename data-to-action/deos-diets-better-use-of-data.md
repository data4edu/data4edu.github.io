# What do I do that DEOs and DIETs start making better use of data?

The DEOs and DIETs have a pressure of making use of data. The issue they face is better use of data. Use of data requires motivation and skill. The motivation to use data comes from two factors â€“
* Having a purpose
* Achieving some success from data-based decision based

Therefore, you need to identify what matters to them and what is of use to them.

For example,
* Which 5 factors bring down the performance of teachers?
* Which one step, if taken, can shift the performance on the indicator related to this?

Once this is done, take data and work on a well-visualised manner to create a repertoire of doable actions. Preferably, take an issue where you can see quick results. Help the DEO and DIETs to implement the plan and achieve success, generate appreciation for the success and repeat this cycle.
