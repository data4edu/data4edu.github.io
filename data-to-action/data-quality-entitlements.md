# What does the data say about the quality of entitlements?

Data generally has been used to assess whether an entitlement has been provided or not. For instance, have textbooks been given, does the school have a girls toilet, an adequate number of classrooms, etc.

What data often does not tell us is the quality of these entitlements. For instance, does the girls toilet have running water; is it clean; does it have light? Are the textbooks provided on time to all students; is the printing quality good? Do classrooms have lights, fans, and windows? Do they all have blackboards, tables and chairs for each student, do they have bulletin boards?

It is important to assess the quality of entitlements provided.

**Note:** Some state datasets do collect this information.
