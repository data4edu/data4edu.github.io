# What is the GER or NER for my school?

The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) or Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) are calculated using the projected population for a specific age group. For example, the GER at the primary level is calculated by dividing the enrolment in Class 1 to 5 by the projected population in the age group of 6-10 years.

Since statistics on projected population are usually published at the national, state and district level only, it is not possible to calculate the GER/NER of a school.

One may make a rough calculation using enrolment figures of the school and the total number of children in the school’s neighbouring community. However, it is possible that some students from the community are enrolled in other schools. Thus, the calculated figure is not useful.
