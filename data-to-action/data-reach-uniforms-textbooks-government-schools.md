# Which data will tell me that the uniforms and textbooks are reaching government schools in time? 

States have different mechanisms of procurement and distribution of uniforms and textbooks. 

**Textbooks:** In some states, textbook distribution is done by textbook press (Andhra Pradesh). In others, it is done by central and zonal depots (Assam), private publishers (Meghalaya) and authorised dealers (Gujarat). 

**Uniforms:** School authorities invite tenders from uniform vendors, select a vendor, conduct quality assurance and procure uniforms. 

To determine whether textbooks and uniforms are reaching in time, the following data sources can be useful: 
1. Data from Data Capture Format (DCF) Section 5 in UDISE+: Incentives and facilities provided to children (For Government and Government Aided schools only) 
2. Distribution records: The records maintained by the schools for distribution of uniforms. 
3. Monitoring system: Some states like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have an QR code based online tracking mechanism to monitor distribution from the textbook corporation to blocks and schools. For others, you will have to track the records maintained at the block and school level.   

To find out the reasons for delay, you can find the system of procurement and distribution and look into grievance data to check for complaints related to uniforms or textbooks.
