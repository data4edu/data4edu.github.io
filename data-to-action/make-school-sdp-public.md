# Should I make the school SDP public? Will it help in getting more support from the Panchayat?

Yes, it is critical to make the school SDP public. This shows a clear path chosen by the school and its SMC for progress in the school, and displays what is being done to improve things. This is another way to involve people in the functioning of the school. By showing the work that is planned, it highlights that school functionaries are doing their job. Furthermore, the Panchayat also gets a sense of what is planned to be funded through Samagra Shiksha, and can therefore allocate its resources accordingly. It can also be used to request the Panchayat for funds for things which are not on the SDP.
