# How can I use school infrastructure data to further improve the quality of my school?

School infrastructure data is already collected for each school and is available on U-DISE report cards. One way to use this information is to identify gaps for the school. For instance, does the school have usable toilets with water? Are there enough classrooms? Does each classroom have fans and lights? Are there enough computer labs? Is there a playground and boundary wall? Once this assessment has been made, these gaps need to be prioritised in terms of urgency. For instance, the school must make an assessment of which gaps are most critical. Subsequently, these gaps should be reflected in the annual school plan to request for resources from Samagra Shiksha. If all gaps cannot be addressed through the scheme, resources can be requested from the Panchayat, or through other sources like CSR. Essentially, assessing data on school infrastructure is the first step in addressing gaps and improving the quality of the school.
