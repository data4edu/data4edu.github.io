# How is collecting information on students from EWS families useful? How can I use it at district/block/cluster level?

Collecting information on students from economically weaker sections (EWS) families is a valuable practice with significant implications for educational planning and improvement, especially at the block or cluster level. This data provides insights that can be harnessed in two essential ways to enhance the quality of education.

1. First, at the block/cluster level, data on students from EWS families can inform targeted resource allocation and support mechanisms. By understanding the proportion of students falling into this category, educational authorities can design block-level plans that cater to the specific needs of these students. This may include allocating resources for initiatives like additional educational support, scholarships, transportation assistance, or free meals to address barriers that EWS students may face in accessing and participating in quality education.
2. Second, at the school level, monitoring efforts can focus on evaluating the effectiveness of programs aimed at addressing the needs of EWS students. This involves examining whether programs are implemented in a sensitive and appropriate manner and identifying any gaps or areas requiring additional support. These findings can be reported at the block/cluster level, facilitating collaboration with higher authorities to secure further assistance and refine strategies for better outcomes. Collecting data on students from EWS families thus ensures that educational plans and interventions are not only inclusive but also actively responsive to the specific challenges faced by this particular social category, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and quality education system.
