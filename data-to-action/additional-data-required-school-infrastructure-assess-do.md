# Is there additional data required on school infrastructure? How can I assess this? And what can I do about it?

Often, data is collected on whether the school has a toilet or not. However, its usability may not always be reflected in the data. For instance, does it have water, or is it clean and usable? Data on the number of classrooms may be collected, but is there data on capacity of the classroom, does the classroom have a blackboard, does it have fans, lights, and electricity? 

The principle to be followed here is to make a list of what is required in each aspect of school infrastructure, as the examples above highlight. Subsequently, these gaps should be addressed in school plans, and resources can be sought from Samagra Shiksha, local Panchayat funds, or through CSR.
