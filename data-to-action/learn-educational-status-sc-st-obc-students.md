# How can I learn about the educational status of students belonging to SC/ST/OBC groups?
Understanding the educational status of students from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) is crucial for addressing educational inequalities and ensuring inclusivity in the Indian education system. Several data sources provide valuable insights into the educational status of these marginalised groups.

One essential data source is the [Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE)](/resources/datasets#unified-district-information-system-for-education-plus-udise), which collects comprehensive data on school infrastructure, student enrolment, and teacher information, often disaggregated by social categories. By analysing UDISE data, you can gain insights into enrolment rates, dropout rates, and the availability of essential facilities like separate toilets for girls, which is essential for ensuring the dignity and safety of students, particularly in rural areas. Policymakers can also use this data to assess whether schools in SC/ST/OBC areas have adequate resources, including classrooms, libraries, and sanitation facilities. This information is useful for identifying gaps and allocating resources accordingly to create a conducive learning environment.

Additionally, the [National Achievement Survey (NAS)](/resources/datasets#national-achievement-survey-nas) can be a valuable resource for assessing the learning outcomes of students from SC, ST, and OBC groups. NAS provides standardised assessments that enable educators and policymakers to gauge the academic performance of students at different grade levels. Analysing NAS data can help identify learning gaps and tailor interventions to improve educational outcomes for marginalised groups.

The [National Family Health Survey (NFHS)](resources/datasets/#national-family-health-survey-nfhs) is another relevant data source. Although primarily focused on health-related data, NFHS includes information on educational indicators, including literacy rates and school attendance, often broken down by social categories. This data can offer insights into the overall educational status of these groups. Furthermore, NFHS data can reveal the health and living conditions of students' families, which can have a direct impact on their education. School authorities can collaborate with health departments to address health-related barriers that may hinder SC/ST/OBC students' educational progress.

To make the best use of this data, educators, policymakers, and other stakeholders can:
1. Identify Disparities: Analyse the data to identify disparities in enrollment, dropout rates, and learning outcomes among SC, ST, and OBC students.
2. Design Targeted Interventions: Use the insights gained from data analysis to develop and implement targeted interventions, such as scholarships, remedial programs, or teacher training, to address the specific challenges faced by these groups.
3. Monitor Progress: Regularly track progress by comparing data over time to assess the impact of interventions and adjust strategies as needed.
4. Advocate for Policy Changes: Use data-driven evidence to advocate for policy changes and resource allocation that can help bridge educational gaps and promote social inclusion.

In summary, by utilising data sources like UDISE, NAS, NFHS, and others, stakeholders can gain a comprehensive understanding of the educational status of SC, ST, and OBC students. This information is invaluable for formulating targeted policies and initiatives that can uplift these marginalised communities and promote equity in education.
