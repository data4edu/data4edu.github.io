# What useful information can I learn from PTR data?

The Pupil Teacher Ratio or PTR is calculated as an aggregate figure at a specific school level. For example, the PTR for Primary level would be calculated by dividing the total enrollment in Class 1 to 5 by the number of teachers teaching those classes. PTR can be calculated at an individual school level or at the block/circle, district, state or national level.
The fact that PTR is calculated as an aggregate reduces the level of detail that can be inferred from it. For example, look at the data for these two schools below:

|School|Pupil Teacher Ratio|Classes|Enrolment|Teachers|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|School 1|30:1|5|60|2|
|School 2|35:1|5|350|10|


If we look at the PTR figures only, we can see that School 1 has 30 students per teacher, while School 2 has 35 students per teacher. From this one may infer that School 1 is better than School 2, however, the picture changes if we look at the number of teachers per class. In School 1, only 2 teachers are looking after 5 classes, making it a multi-grade school. However, in School 2, there are 10 teachers for 5 classes.

PTR figures can be helpful but should not be the only metric when ascertaining a school or regionâ€™s educational status.

Nonetheless, PTR can be a helpful metric. Here are a few ways in which PTR can be used:
1. Examining PTR figures can aid in resource allocation decisions. If a school or district/state consistently has a high PTR, it may be an indicator that more resources should be allocated to hiring additional teachers or building new schools to reduce overcrowding. Conversely, areas with a low PTR may consider reallocating resources to address other educational needs.
2. PTR data can inform long-term infrastructure planning. For instance, if an area experiences a consistent increase in student enrollment, it may be necessary to build new schools or expand existing ones to maintain an acceptable PTR and ensure a high standard of education.
3. PTR figures can guide decisions regarding teacher training and professional development programs. Areas with high PTR may benefit from targeted training to help teachers effectively manage larger classrooms.
