# Which data sets can tell me reasons for certain groups (for example, CWD, EWS, Girls) not attending school?

Most public data sets do not usually record data on student attendance. Even if some third-party research reports record it, the granularity of data is not assured. For example, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) published by the ASER Centre records data on student and teacher attendance but does not provide reasons for absence. It also does not disaggregate data by social groups. However, it provides broadstroke time series data on attendance patterns, which may be useful for some cases.

Thus, for understanding reasons behind absenteeism of certain social groups, it is best to conduct a field survey. The school education departmentâ€™s wherewithal may be utilised for a state or district-level survey. In case the catchment area is limited to a smaller geographical region, it may be best to speak to the school teachers and community leaders to get a reliable contextual picture.
