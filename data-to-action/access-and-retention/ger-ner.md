# What can I learn about my state from seeing both the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) together?
The GER and NER of a state can reveal several important indicators about the state's education system:

1. **Identification of over-age and under-age students:** The gap between the GER and NER of the state indicates the number of enrolled students who are not within the target age-group of the particular school level. That is, there are students who are either over-age or under-age.
2. **Assessment of Access to Education:** The GER and NER can be used to assess the overall access to education at a specific level within the state. A consistently high NER indicates that the state is successful in providing access to education for children in the corresponding age group. On the other hand, a consistently low NER may signify challenges in access or participation, which need further investigation.
3. **Identification of Disparities:** When GER or NER data is disaggregated by gender, social groups, and geographical areas, it can highlight disparities within the state. For example, a significant difference in GER/NER between urban and rural areas may indicate an urban-rural education gap. Examining gender-specific GER/NER can reveal gender disparities in access to education.
4. **Early Warning System for Dropout Rates:** While GER and NER provide insights into enrollment, they can be used as a preliminary indicator of potential dropout rates. A significant drop in GER or NER from one level of education to the next signals dropout issues that need attention.
5. **Monitoring Progress over Time:** Analysing GER or NER trends over multiple years can help track the state's progress in improving access to education. Increasing GER/NER values over time can be a positive sign of educational development and outreach.
6. **Policy Evaluation:** Policymakers can use GER/NER data to evaluate the effectiveness of educational policies and interventions. If there's a specific policy aimed at increasing enrollment in a certain age group, monitoring changes in NER can assess the impact of that policy.
7. **Resource Allocation:** High GER/NER values may indicate that resources, such as teachers, infrastructure, and learning materials, are needed to accommodate the larger number of enrolled students. Lower NER values may signal underutilised resources and may require reallocation or improvement.
8. **Comparative Analysis:** GER and NER can be used for comparative analysis between states or regions within the same state. This can help identify areas where the state might be excelling or lagging behind in terms of education access and enrollment.
Thus, stakeholders can use data on GER and NER as a basis for data-driven decision-making.
