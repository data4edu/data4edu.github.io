# How can I use dropout data to set a priority order of schools that should be upgraded to a higher level?

Assuming you are working on upgrading schools from Upper Primary to Secondary and from Secondary to Higher Secondary level, you can use this strategy –
1. First, identify schools that have a significant enrollment in their terminal class. Let’s say “significant” means 50 students. So our first step becomes: **List all the schools that have more than 50 students studying in Class 8 (for UP) or Class 10 (for Secondary).**
2. Second, identify schools that do not have a higher level school nearby. So our second step becomes: **List all the Upper Primary (/Secondary) schools that do not have a Secondary (/Higher Secondary) school within a 5km radius.**
3. Third, identify schools that fall in disadvantaged regions. These could include areas that have high dropout rates, low enrolment rates, or are dominated by a social minority. So an example of our third step could be: **List all the schools that are situated in a block/circle that has high dropout rates.**
