# How is collecting information on students from migrant families useful? How can I use it at the district/block/cluster level?

At the district/block/cluster level, having information on students from migrant families can assist in two ways in ensuring the target of quality education for all can be achieved.

1. One, it can assist in providing necessary resources to schools through block plans in a targeted way, such as ensuring teachers are sensitised to the issues of migrant students such as language barriers and adjusting to a new setting and potentially new culture, and so on.
2. Two, monitoring at school level can include aspects of enquiring what measures are being taken to ensure migrant studentsâ€™ needs are catered to, if programmes are being implemented appropriately and sensitively, and to find out what additional support is required. These issues can also be raised to higher levels by the block/cluster to seek additional support.
