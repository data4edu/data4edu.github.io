# Should I make the school UDISE report public? Will people understand it? Will it help in getting more support from the Panchayat?

Yes, making the report public is good practice. This information can enable greater participation from the public, especially those whose children are in that school. This interest and participation is crucial in raising resources for the school. For instance, if people see the report card and realise that there are some infrastructural gaps, they can raise the issue with the Gram Panchayat or with local leaders to escalate the issue. SMC members may also be more motivated to participate in school affairs. This can also be used to mobilise funds.

People may not understand it initially, or may only understand some bits. But teachers or the HM may take some time to explain the data. This helps in creating accountability and greater participation, and is the foundation of facilitating the voice of citizens in a democracy. Citizen participation will only bring teachers and people closer together, to work jointly on issues faced by the school.
