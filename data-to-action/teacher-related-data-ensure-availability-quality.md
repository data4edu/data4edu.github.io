# What all teacher related data do I require in order to ensure teacher availability and quality?

Teacher availability can often be a challenge, especially in remote areas. The lack of teachers directly impacts students and their learning levels. 

The data required are the following: 

* Locality, or preferred locality
* Subjects and grades taught
* Transfer history 
* Teacher requirements for each school including number of teachers and subject and grade specific requirements
