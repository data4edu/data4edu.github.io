# How can I learn about the impact of vocational training on school education in my state?

Understanding the impact of vocational training on school education in your state involves exploring various facets. 

Firstly, assess the implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, within your state's educational framework. The NEP emphasises a more integrated approach by eliminating the rigid distinction between vocational and academic streams in schools. At the secondary and higher secondary level, many students may opt to pursue vocational training instead of traditional school education, the NEP recommends that there should be “no hard separation of ‘vocational’ and ‘academic’ streams” in schools and sets the objective to “provide access to vocational education to at least 50% of all learners by 2025.” 

To gauge the impact, consider researching the enrolment rates in vocational courses at the secondary and higher secondary levels. Analyse the extent to which students are opting for vocational training over traditional academic streams. Look into the diversity of vocational courses offered and whether they align with the evolving demands of the job market.

Evaluate the infrastructure and resources allocated for vocational education in schools. Adequate facilities, qualified instructors, and up-to-date curriculum are crucial for the success of vocational training programs. Assess the accessibility of vocational education, ensuring that it reaches students across urban and rural areas, promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities.

Furthermore, explore the collaborations between educational institutions and industries to facilitate practical exposure and skill development. Vocational training programs should ideally incorporate real-world experiences and internships to enhance the employability of students.

To gain a comprehensive understanding, seek out reports or studies conducted by educational authorities, NGOs, or independent researchers on the outcomes of vocational training initiatives in your state. These sources can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these programs, including employment rates, success stories, and challenges faced by students undergoing vocational training.

In conclusion, to learn about the impact of vocational training on school education in your state, delve into enrolment patterns, infrastructure provisions, industry collaborations, and available research studies.
