# How can I use SLAS/NAS data to find areas of focus for my school?

To use NAS/SLAS data to find areas of focus, you can:

1. Identify priority areas for change by looking at the LO scores (forming groups of LOs at some places may help in this). You can set the basis for setting priority by looking at LOs with 
    1. Weakest performance 
    2. Most neglected areas 
    3. Those LOs/aspects in which improving performance will have the greatest or fastest impact on other LOs/aspects.   
2. Analyse the reasons for lack of performance (with a detailed analysis presenting several examples). Try and analyse the following: 
    1. Which of these causes must be influenced for improvement?
    2. Redefine the change you want, taking into account what you have done so far. 
3. Identify strategies and methods 
    1. Under what conditions can this change occur (examples)
    2. What are the ways to create this state (examples)
4. Identify activities and develop road map (actions) by planning 
    1. What actions are involved in implementing these methods (examples)
    2. What is the sequence of these activities, duration, scheduling, responsibilities, evidence and budget â€“ this is the road map (examples and format)
