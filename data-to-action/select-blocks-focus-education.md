# Can I look at a few blocks in my district rather than all of them to find areas of focus in education? How do I select which blocks to look at?

As a district-level decision-maker, you can strategically select specific blocks to focus on rather than trying to address all of them at once. To make this choice, consider these factors:

1. **Data Analysis:** Analyse educational data to identify blocks with the most significant challenges in student performance, attendance, infrastructure, and other key indicators.
2. **Prioritisation:** Prioritise blocks based on the severity of issues, resource availability, and alignment with your long-term district goals.
3. **Community Input:** Consult with local education stakeholders for insights into the specific challenges faced by different blocks.
