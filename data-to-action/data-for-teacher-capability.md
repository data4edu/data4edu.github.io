# What data is required to better understand the state of teacher capability, and then how can that data be used to improve the same?

It is hard to get a full assessment of teaching capability as there is no data on pedagogical practices followed in class. These would include things like how the teacher explains topics, how they engage students, etc. In fact, there is no unified pedagogical framework that can be used as a benchmark.  

As a proxy however, some of the following indicators can be used to assess capability: 
* Teacher qualifications
* Teacher experience
* In-service trainings completed
* Learning outcomes/academic performance of students
* School infrastructure and teaching learning materials (to be accounted for when assessing quality - if supporting material is not available, it could explain poor academic performance) 

Historical data on the same can be used to create specific training programmes for teachers to improve quality. 

Furthermore, the state can create a pedagogical framework and find ways to assess the same.
