# How do I check if plans reflect actual needs of people? Is that possible?

One challenge highlighted in studies has been that schools may have needs which may even be expressed in School Development Plans (SDPs) but do not receive funding or resources for the same. For instance, a school may need drinking water facilities urgently but receives funding for a boundary wall. How can this be addressed? 
The state can do the following: 

1. The state can conduct surveys in schools across districts, selected randomly. The survey can include 2 groups of respondents. 
    1. One, the people whose children attend the school, to understand from them if their needs have been expressed in school plans. 
    2. Two, the teachers of school to understand if their needs were in the plan, and if funding was received from them. If gaps are observed, then the findings can be used to understand if there is a gap in the planning process. 
2. Often, UDISE data is used to allocate resources. This method can be useful if UDISE data are completely accurate. Therefore, a UDISE audit of random schools can be conducted to assess if the data matches reality. 
3. Given that SDPs are not necessarily made across all schools, or not made in a participative manner, the state can launch a campaign for school planning. Elements of the campaign can include the timely creation of plans, participation from the panchayat, members of the village, and the SMC, as well as local officials to ensure plans are made. Awareness campaigns can also be conducted to improve public participation, and building a culture of planning for schools while keeping students at the centre of the process.
4. Social audits can also be conducted across the state - both to include citizen voice and increase accountability, and also as a feedback mechanism to highlight gaps and strengthen planning.
