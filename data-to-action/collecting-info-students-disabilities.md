# How is collecting information on students with disabilities useful? How can I use it at district/block/cluster level?

At the district/block/cluster level, having information on the number of students with disabilities and the type of disabilities can assist in two ways in ensuring the target of quality education for all can be achieved. 

1. One, it can assist in providing necessary resources to schools through block plans in a targeted way, such as textbooks in braille, ramps for schools, teachers who have special training, and so on. 
2. Two, monitoring at school level can include aspects of enquiring what support is being provided to students with disabilities, if teachers are using appropriate measures to cater to students with disabilities, and to find out what additional support is required. These issues can also be raised to higher levels by the block/cluster to seek additional support.
