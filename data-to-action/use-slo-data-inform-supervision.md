# How can I use student learning outcome data to inform my supervision? 

Student learning outcomes are expectations at the end of a teaching-learning experience of the content. Therefore, the student learning outcome data can be looked at, in the following ways: 

* What is it that students find difficult? 
* Is there a connection between student learning outcomes where students have scored low? 
* Is there a linkage with concepts taught previously? 

This will assist you to:  
1. **Set expectations:** Align supervision with support that the teachers would require to address the gaps. Talk to teachers and support them to plan a sequence of steps that can be taken, to improve learning. 
2. **Conduct data-informed observations:** During classroom observations, see if the teaching strategies being used are helpful in improving student outcomes, and provide feedback and support based on evidence.
3. **Plan professional development:** Use student learning outcome data to identify areas where teachers may benefit from additional professional development. Plan training sessions, workshops, or resources to address specific needs and enhance their instructional practices.
4. **Monitor progress and provide feedback:** Provide feedback to teachers. Support them with teaching ideas, materials and discussion, as required.   
5. **Promote collaboration:** Encourage a supportive and collaborative environment where educators can learn from one another.
