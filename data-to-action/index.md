## Getting Started
Before you begin exploring the questions on this website, you may wonder why you should use data to improve education. The answer is simple: **data can help you make better decisions.**
1. It can help you identify problems, understand their root causes, and develop effective solutions.
2. It can also help you monitor the impact of your decisions and refine your strategies to achieve better results.

If this doesn't convince you, perhaps the following questions will:

{% for page in site.pages %}
  {% if page.categories contains 'general' %}
  -  [{{page.description}}]({{site.url}}{{page.url}})
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Categories
The content on this website is organized into the following categories. Each category contains a set of questions that are relevant to the topic. The questions are designed to help you think about how you can use data to improve the quality of education in your state, district, or school. The questions are not exhaustive, and you are encouraged to add your own questions to the list.

### [Access and Retention](./access-and-retention/)
This category focuses on understanding and ensuring access to education while addressing issues related to student retention. The questions delve into various aspects such as enrollment trends, dropout rates, infrastructure requirements, and the effectiveness of entitlement programs. The goal is to use data to identify barriers to access, improve retention rates, and prioritize schools for upgrades or interventions.

### [Equity](./equity/)
Equity in education is the central theme of this category. It emphasizes the collection and analysis of data related to diverse student demographics, including economic status (EWS families), gender, migration background, social categories, disabilities, and entitlements for specific groups. The aim is to use this information to promote inclusivity, address disparities, and enhance the quality of education at both individual schools and broader administrative levels.

### [Planning and Monitoring](./planning-and-monitoring/)
Planning and monitoring involve the strategic use of data to develop, assess, and refine educational plans. The questions in this category cover topics such as creating district-level report cards, making school plans public, using data to secure additional funding, involving school management committees, and ensuring the accuracy of data at various administrative levels. The focus is on leveraging data for effective decision-making, resource allocation, and continuous improvement.

### [Quality](./quality/)
Quality in education is the central concern of this category, examining factors like academic results, teacher capability, vocational training, and the impact of various programs on learning outcomes. The questions explore how data can be used to evaluate and improve teacher training programs, assess the effectiveness of educational initiatives, and enhance the overall quality of education. Additionally, it addresses the use of data for library management, selecting areas of focus, and improving vocational education facilities in schools.

## Geographies

The questions in each category are tailored to the needs of stakeholders at that level. However, the questions are <span class="popover" tooltip-title="For example, a question tagged for the state level may also be relevant for district-level administrators">not mutually exclusive</span>, and you are encouraged to explore questions from other categories as well.

### [State](./state-level/)
Questions tagged for the state level focus on overarching policies, resource allocation, and strategic planning for education at a broader administrative scale. State-level administrators would use this information to make informed decisions regarding statewide initiatives, funding distribution, and the development of comprehensive educational policies.

### [District or Sub-district](./district-or-sub-district-level/)
Tagged questions for the district, block or cluster level are tailored to the needs of local administrators responsible for managing a specific geographical area. These questions address issues related to district-level planning, resource allocation, and the implementation of policies. The focus is on tailoring strategies to meet the unique challenges and characteristics of individual districts or sub-districts.

### [School](./school-level/)
Questions under the school tag are designed for stakeholders at the individual school level. These include teachers, principals, and school management committees. The emphasis is on practical, on-the-ground concerns such as student access, equity, planning, and quality improvement within the specific context of a single school. These questions help school-level stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance the educational experience for their students.
