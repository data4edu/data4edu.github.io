# How can I use my data to request support from other departments? Eg: power department, water department etc.

There are two different things to assess. One, what is the support required from other departments. Two, how does data play a role in determining that.

Various departments can play a role in improving various aspects of school education. For instance, schools should have electricity and running water so the power and water departments become relevant. Other examples include coordinating with the health department for check ups, or with the women and child development department for pre-school education.

Data can help in assessing requirements and planning coordinated interventions. For instance, data on how many schools do not have electricity, or have a limited supply can be used to create a plan with the power department to supply electricity. Data on the number of students in each school can be used to create a plan for health check ups with the health department. You can think of other such examples.
