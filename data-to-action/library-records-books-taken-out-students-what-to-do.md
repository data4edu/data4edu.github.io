# I have a library at my school. I kept records of which books were taken out and which students took out the most books. What can I do with this record that will help me and my students?

Maintaining records of books borrowed by students from your school library is an excellent practice, and this data can be leveraged in various ways to benefit both you and your students.

Firstly, this record can help you understand the reading preferences and habits of your students. By identifying which books are most frequently borrowed, you can gain insights into the types of content that resonate with your students. This knowledge can guide your book selection process, ensuring that the library is stocked with materials that cater to their interests and needs. Additionally, it allows you to curate thematic displays and reading lists, promoting a culture of reading and encouraging students to explore different genres and subjects.

Secondly, as books are categorised for age and grade-appropriate reading, you can know which category of books are preferred. You can procure more books in this category related to themes in the subsequent category so students can graduate to the next level.

From the student data, you will get to know which grade students are accessing books. For those who are not, you might have to make changes to the time-table so they can do so.

Furthermore, you can use this data to recognise and celebrate the reading achievements of your students. For example, you can establish reading challenges or rewards for students who borrow a certain number of books within a given period. Acknowledging and rewarding active library users can motivate more students to engage with the library and develop a lifelong love for reading. This not only fosters a culture of learning but also enhances their literacy skills and overall academic performance.
