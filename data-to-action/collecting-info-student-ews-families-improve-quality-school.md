# How is collecting information on students from EWS families useful? How can I use it to improve quality and classroom practices in my school?

Collecting information on students from Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) families is a crucial component of quality education planning and classroom practices. This data provides valuable insights that can significantly enhance the educational experience for these students and, in turn, improve overall classroom quality.

- **Socio-economic Status:** When you have access to information about EWS students, you can better understand the economic challenges they may face. For many of these students, regular attendance can be a struggle due to various factors like the need to contribute to family income. With this knowledge, you can create strategies that accommodate their unique circumstances. Setting aside specific times during the day or week for additional support can help bridge any gaps in their learning while the rest of the class works on self-learning tasks. It's essential to recognise that some EWS students may not have adequate support at home, so encouraging interaction with parents and guiding them on how to engage with their child's education can be immensely beneficial.
- **Leveraging Their Life Experiences and Utilising Their 'Fund of Knowledge':** EWS students often have valuable life experiences, such as contributing to household chores or economic activities, that can be integrated into classroom learning. Understanding these experiences and using them as educational resources can make the learning process more engaging and relevant for these students. For example, you can connect these experiences to subjects being taught, helping them see the practical applications of their knowledge.
- **Creating a Supportive Environment:** Preventing Dropout: EWS students are at a higher risk of dropping out of school, particularly in the post-pandemic context where learning losses have been a significant concern. By gathering data about their socio-economic background, you can tailor your teaching methods to provide the necessary support. Ensuring that students have a solid foundation of pre-requisite knowledge before moving on to more advanced topics can help build their confidence and reduce the risk of dropout.

In conclusion, collecting information about students from EWS families is essential for creating a more inclusive and effective learning environment. It equips educators with the knowledge needed to develop classroom practices that address the unique challenges these students face, ultimately improving the quality of education and increasing their chances of academic success.
