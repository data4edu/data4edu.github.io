# How can teacher education programmes be improved, using data on school education?

1. Data on school education can inform the curriculum design by aligning with ground realities that teachers will face. For example, class size, student diversity, degree of multi grade class, absence of certain subject teachers. 
2. Data from the [National Achievement Survey (NAS)](/resources/datasets#national-achievement-survey-nas) can be analysed to understand and strengthen the areas of low performance. 
3. Attendance and participation rates can be studied to know what time of the year students remain absent. This will inform teaching concepts to be taught in a spiralling approach so students can cope with the syllabus being covered.
4. The socio-economic status and student diversity data can be analysed to identify the student context and inform the teaching process.
