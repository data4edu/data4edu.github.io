# What steps do I take to ensure that the data relevant to my school is correct? 

To ensure that the data relevant to your school is correct, you can do the following:

1. Verify the initial data entry – Check the accuracy of the data entered during the registration process. For example, the school’s name, UDISE code and category. If there is a discrepancy, check with the block admin and get it rectified. 
2. Add/edit the sections in the Data Capture Format – There are 11 sections in the DCF. These are:
    1. School profile - location, structure, management and medium of instruction.
    2. Physical facilities and equipment 
    3. Teaching and non-teaching staff 
    4. New admissions, enrolments and repeaters
    5. Incentives and facilities provided to children (for government and government aided schools only)
    6. Annual examination result at elementary level   
    7. Board examination result 
    8. Receipts and expenditure
    9. Vocational education under NSQF (only for secondary and higher secondary schools) 
    10. PGI and other indicators (only for government and government aided schools)
    11. School safety 
3. After this step, you can validate data by clicking on Form 40.
4. When you enter form 40, click on the validation button. This will verify the data against check points given and will list the errors. For example, look at this error ‘Form number 4.2 (PP) Schools with no pre-primary section but enrolment for pre primary entered’. This means there is an error in form number 4.2 (PP). You can note these errors and correct it in the relevant form number in the DCF. 
5. Once done, click on the validate button. If the entry is correct, the right column will show ‘successful’.
