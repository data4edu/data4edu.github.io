# About This Website

This website will help you understand:
- What is a data system for education and how should it serve the goals of the education system?
- What principles should one follow while conceptualising one?
- The role that people at various levels can play in using data effectively

It will provide:
- Contextualising goals and requirements to evaluate progress
- Examples of what data systems could look like
- Demonstrated examples of how to use data to further quality education
- The potential impact of using data effectively

## Why this website?
We believe these tools can serve various stakeholders - from high level policy makers who frame principles for the education system to teachers working in schools. First, at the highest level, this tool can enable more robust system design and subsequent functioning. The tool will also provide principles to create avenues in the system to reflect and change course, as needed. Further, examples of effective data use can easily be used to remake existing data systems to function more smoothly.
