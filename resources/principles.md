|Data collectors should also be users of data. | Functionaries collecting data are overworked, and do not have a mandate to use data in their day-to-day work. There is a culture, therefore, of a lack of ownership, and data collection is treated as a chore, which affects quality. When collectors are also users, they understand the value of data in a better way, and build their own understanding and could lead to improved performance.|
