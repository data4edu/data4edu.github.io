# Checklist for Data Entry with Google Sheets

So you have decided to create a format in a Google Sheets file and have people fill data by collaborating in the same file. Follow this checklist to make sure you have covered all bases!

- [ ] Have you made sure that Google Sheets is the most suitable tool for the job? Are you sure that this data cannot be entered using a Google Form?
- [ ] Have you ensured that the format you have created is suitable for the data that you want to collect? Are you sure that you are collecting a <span class="popover" tooltip-title="Neither more nor less than necessary.">reasonable amount of data</span>?
  - [ ] Have you asked someone who is not associated with this project to take a look at the data entry format? Did they understand how to enter the data on their own without your help?
  - [ ] Are you 110% sure that your format is easy to understand?
- [ ] Have you checked that the necessary data validation rules are in place? Are you sure that only the expected data will be input by the respondents?
- [ ] Do you have a list of all the people with whom you will share this Google Sheets file? Are you sure that they will know how to fill the format?
  - [ ] Have you added [protection to sheets/ranges](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1218656?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) to prevent unwanted edits?
  - [ ] Have you set a deadline for the data entry process? Has this date been communicated with the respondents?
- [ ] Have you decided if you are going to conduct a pilot test of the questionnaire? Is there a good reason for that decision?
- [ ] Is there a plan in place for how the collected data will be analysed and reported?
