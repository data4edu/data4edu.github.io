## Overall
### Performance Grading Index (PGI)
[Click here to visit the PGI website]

The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is published by the Ministry of Education on an annual basis. The Index was first introduced in 2017 and it was envisaged that “the Index will propel States and Union Territories (UTs) towards undertaking multi-pronged interventions that will bring about the much-desired optimal education outcomes.”

The PGI provides insights on the status of school education in States & UTs, including key levers that drive their performance and critical areas of performance. It also motivates States and UTs to adopt best practices followed by the top performing States.

The latest available report for the session 2021-22 was released in July 2023. This report marked the introduction of PGI 2.0 – a revision version of the original index. According to the Ministry, it was felt that several states/UTs had reached a saturation point in many indicators and that some indicators were redundant while other important ones were missing from PGI. In the original PGI index, teachers’ education had little to no representation whereas governance indicators were overly representative (making up 360 points out of 1000).

In PGI 2.0 there are 73 indicators now spread over 6 domains (teacher education being the newly introduced one). The overall maximum score attainable remains 1000. A major difference in the scoring is that now data for 69 out of 73 indicators is taken directly from sources like NAS, UDISE+, PM POSHAN and PRABANDH portal. States/UTs have to fill up data for only 4 indicators. Whereas previously States/UTs would fill all the indicators themselves.

### Performance Grading Index – District (PGI-D)
[Click here to visit the PGI-D website]

PGI-District takes the approach of PGI and applies it to all districts of the country. The ultimate objective of PGI-D is to help the Districts to prioritise areas for intervention in school education and thus improve to reach the highest grade.

As of July 2023, two reports have been released under PGI-D: one for 2018-19 & 2019-20, and another for 2020-21 and 2021-22. Of the 83 indicators in PGI-D, data for 55 indicators is filled by the district offices while the remaining are sourced from UDISE+ and NAS. This data is approved by the state office before it is locked and used by the Ministry.

The PGI-D structure comprises total weightage of 600 points, which are grouped under 6 categories viz., Outcomes, Effective Classroom Transaction, Infrastructure Facilities & Student’s Entitlements, School Safety & Child Protection, Digital Learning and Governance Process.

These categories are further divided into 12 domains, viz., Learning Outcomes and Quality (LO), Access Outcomes (AO), Teacher Availability and Professional Development Outcomes (TAPDO), Learning Management (LM), Learning Enrichment Activities (LEA), Infrastructure, Facilities, Student Entitlements (IF&SE), School Safety and Child Protection (SS&CP), Digital Learning (DL), Funds convergence and utilisation (FCV), Enhancing CRCs Performance (CRCP), Attendance Monitoring Systems (AMS) and School Leadership Development (SLD).

### School Education Quality Index (SEQI)
[Click here to visit the SEQI website]

SEQI was introduced by the NITI Aayog around the same time that PGI was introduced by the Ministry of Education. Like the PGI, SEQI too evaluates “the performance of States and Union Territories (UTs) in the school education sector … (and) aims to bring an outcomes focus to education policy by providing States and UTs with a platform to identify their strengths and weaknesses and undertake requisite course corrections or policy interventions”.

SEQI has the same domains as PGI 1.0, except that there are 30 indicators that total 965 points. Additionally, unlike PGI, SEQI uses three categories: Large States, Small States and Union Territories.

### How can this data be useful for educational planning?
Data from PGI, PGI-D and SEQI provide a bird's eye view of the status of education. 

1. Government departments of education can use these reports to identify areas of improvement and set targets for themselves.
2. Researchers can use these reports to compare the performance of states and districts, and identify trends over time.
3. Civil society organisations can use these reports to identify areas of intervention and advocate for policy changes.

### Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+)
[Click here to visit the UDISE+ website]

UDISE+ is a comprehensive data collection system that covers all aspects of school education, from infrastructure to student achievement. From 2018-19, UDISE+ is maintained by the Ministry of Education. Originally, the system was called DISE and was developed and maintained by NIEPA (from 1994-95 to 2017-18).[^1]

[^1]: Learn more about the history of UDISE on [Prof. Arun C Mehta’s blog](https://educationforallinindia.com/rise-fall-of-udise-the-untold-story/).

UDISE+ has a mandate of collecting information from all recognized schools imparting formal education from pre-primary to class XII. This covers all schools including madrasas, private unaided schools, and government aided or sponsored schools. The [Data Capture Formats] cover fields in the following categories: Basic School Profile (Location, Management, Medium of Instruction etc.), School Safety, Receipts and Expenditure, Vocational Education, Physical Facilities and Equipment, and details of students, teachers and non-teaching staff.

All state project offices under Samagra Shiksha have MIS units that manage the activities related to UDISE+. Data is entered at the school level and aggregated at the block, district and state MIS offices. The UDISE+ data for each school year is ‘frozen’ on September 30th of that calendar year. For example, the UDISE+ 2021-22 data reports the status as on September 30th, 2021.

Information collected through UDISE+ is utilised for planning, optimising resource allocation and implementing various education-related programs and assessing progress. It is the only comprehensive credible database of school data in India.

While direct access to the UDISE+ raw data is not available to the general public, the [UDISE+ Reports Dashboard] publishes several useful metrics such as number of schools/teachers/students, enrolment ratios, and availability of infrastructure. Additionally, a request can be made for access to the raw data using the [UDISE+ Data Sharing Portal].

### State Education Management Information System (EMIS)
Several states operate their own EMIS that collect data on a more regular basis (near real-time) than the annual frequency of UDISE+.

These EMIS often act as both a management information system and a service-delivery system. Services related to the education system are usually provided through the EMIS such as issuing transfer certificates to students, managing transfer requests by teaching and non-teaching staff, recording summative (and sometimes formative) assessment results, managing mid-day meal services, and financial management (employee salary disbursal).

In most cases, there is no public access to the data collected on state EMIS platforms. It is also worth noting that given the difference in frequency of data collection between state EMIS and UDISE+, the two datasets often do not match.

A few examples of State EMIS are listed below:
- West Bengal: [Banglar Shiksha]
- Rajasthan: [Shala Darpan]
- Tamil Nadu: [Educational Management Information System (TN-EMIS)]
- Kerala: [Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE)]
- Maharashtra: [SARAL]

### National Achievement Survey (NAS)
[Click here to visit the NAS website]

The National Achievement Survey (NAS) is a large-scale assessment conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for students in classes 3, 5, 8 and 10. The NAS is conducted every three years and is designed to provide information on the learning achievement of students in various subjects. The NAS is conducted in all 36 states and union territories of India on a sample basis.

It is a national representative survey that provides a system level reflection on effectiveness of school education. Most recently, NAS was conducted in November 2021. NAS 2021 covered nearly 3.4 million students studying in approximately 1.18 lakh schools, spanning different categories such as state government, government aided, private unaided and central government.

Historically, NAS was managed by the Education Statistics Division of the NCERT. NAS 2021, however, was conducted through a joint NAS Cell with the efforts of the Ministry of Education, NCERT and CBSE, and other non-governmental bodies such as UNICEF. The NAS Cell is responsible for the overall coordination of the survey, including the development of test items, sampling, training of field functionaries, data collection, data processing, analysis and report writing.

The Survey is conducted in states through the state project offices of Samagra Shiksha. On ground, pre-service teachers, i.e., students enrolled in teacher training programmes such as the Basic Teaching Certificate (BTC) offered by DIETs and PTTIs, are recruited as field investigators. These field investigators are trained by the state project offices and are responsible for administering the test to students in their assigned schools. Spot checks and supervision of the field investigators is done by the state project offices.

The assessment questionnaire under NAS is based on the student learning outcomes developed by the NCERT for each class and subject. The Survey also records a number of background variables that help to accurately discover the students’ performance in different learning outcomes vis-à-vis the contextual variables. For example, NAS makes it possible to know what is the average learning level in Mathematics of class III girl students belonging to the Scheduled Tribes category in Chhattisgarh.

### Foundational Learning Study (FLS) 2022
[Click here to visit the FLS website]

The Ministry of Education launched the National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat in July 2021 as a national mission to enable all children at the end of Grade 3 to attain foundational skills by the year 2026-2027. As a crucial step towards this effort, a Foundational Learning Study (FLS) was conducted in March 2022 on a sample basis covering about 86,000 students in 10,000 schools across the country.

The study covered 20 languages that are being used as mediums of instruction. The objective of the study was to assess learning outcomes of Grade 3 students in foundational literacy and numeracy and establish baseline benchmarks for reading and numeracy for NIPUN Bharat. Unlike the NAS, the field investigator administered the test in a one-on-one setting where each child responded to a set of questions administered orally.

The FLS report matches student performance against a Global Minimum Proficiency (GMP) standard for each language and numeracy. The average student performance is then categorised into four categories (in order): Below Partially Meets GMP; Partially Meets GMP; Meets GMP; Exceeds GMP.

### Project Approval Board (PAB) Minutes
[Click here to visit the PAB Minutes website]

The Project Approval Board (PAB) is the apex body for approving the Annual Work Plan & Budget (AWP&B) of all states, union territories, and national institutions (such as NCERT, TSG) for the next financial year. The PAB meets once a year, usually between February to April, after the Union Budget has been announced. For states and UTs, the PAB reviews the progress of activities under Samagra Shiksha and approves the AWP&B along with certain recommendations.

The PAB Minutes are published every year by the Ministry of Education. These minutes contain details on the proposed programmes and activities by states/UTs and the approved budget for the same, as well as details on spill over funds from the previous year.

### How can this data be useful for educational planning?
While the PAB Minutes are not a comprehensive source of data, they do provide a snapshot of the activities planned by states/UTs for the next financial year. This can be used by researchers and civil society organisations to understand the priorities of states/UTs and identify areas of intervention.
